#Banner Core Grails Plugin

##Status
Production quality, although subsequent changes may not be backward compatible.  Remember to include this software in export compliance reviews when shipping a solution that uses this plugin.

##TL;DR
This plugin adds Spring Security (aka Acegi) and a custom DataSource implementation (BannerDS) that together provide for authentication and authorization based upon Banner Security configuration. This plugin also provides additional framework support (e.g., providing a base class (ServiceBase) for transactional services and providing base test classes) to facilitate development of Banner web applications. Lastly, this plugin provides additional Banner 'general' support including Supplemental Data Engine (SDE) and Multi-Entity Processing (MEP).

Key features provided by the plugin include:

* Configuring Spring Security for authentication (form-based, CAS, external) and authorization (based upon the existing Banner 8 security model)
* A specialized 'Datasource' that will proxy a database connection for an authenticated, administrative user.  This is done so Oracle FGAC remains effective even when connections are managed in a shared pool. Note that administrative user connections are cached for the duration of the user's HTTP session.
* A filter that sets a 'FormContext' which identifies a corresponding Banner Oracle Form for the current request. This is based upon a 'formControllerMap' map within Config.groovy and is used to ensure only applicable roles are unlocked on the connection during the request.
* A special 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY' Spring Security role that is used to grant access if the logged in user has any roles (other than those ending with '_Q' and '_CONNECT') that pertain to the FormContext associated to the URI.
* A base class for transactional services, which provides default CRUD implementations and pre/post hook methods that may be overriden in subclasses to perform additional work (e.g., cross-domain validation).
* Base classes for integration and functional tests that facilitate testing of exceptions, logging in and out, etc.

#Installation and quickstart
The recommended approach is to install the plugin as a git submodule.

##Add Git submodule
To add the plugin as a Git submodule under a 'plugins' directory:

        $ git submodule add ssh://git@devgit1/banner/plugins/banner_core.git plugins/banner_core.git
        Cloning into 'plugins/banner_core.git'...
        remote: Counting objects: 1585, done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (925/925), done.
        remote: Total 1585 (delta 545), reused 309 (delta 72)
        Receiving objects: 100% (1585/1585), 294.45 KiB | 215 KiB/s, done.
        Resolving deltas: 100% (545/545), done.

Then add the in-place plugin definition to BuildConfig.groovy:

        grails.plugin.location.'banner-core' = "plugins/banner_core.git"

Note that adding the plugin this way will the latest commit on the master branch at the time you ran the submodule command.  If you want to use an official release instead, go to the plugin directory and checkout a specific version, e.g.:

    cd plugins/banner_core.git
    git checkout pub-2.7.3

Don't forget to go back to your project root and commit the change, as this will establish your project's git submodule dependency to the desired commit of the plugin.


##2. Configure plugin dependencies
The plugin depends on spring-security-cas, banner-codenarc, and i18n-core plugins.  These dependencies are configured in BuildConfig.groovy and are expected to be 'sibling' git submodule dependencies for your project.  That is, it is the containing project's responsibility to ensure these plugin dependencies are available on the file system.  If you adopt a different approach, you will need to modify the location of these dependencies by editing BuildConfig.groovy:

        grails.plugin.location.'spring-security-cas' = "../spring_security_cas.git"
        grails.plugin.location.'banner-codenarc'     = "../banner_codenarc.git"
        grails.plugin.location.'i18n-core'           = "../i18n_core.git"


###Configure UrlMappings
Edit the UrlMappings.groovy to include appropriate mappings.  The below mappings may be considered:

#####For SSB apps:
The mappings below are usually added to support Banner XE self-service applications.

    "/ssb/menu" {
        controller = "selfServiceMenu"
        action = [GET: "data", POST: "create"]
    }

    "/ssb/i18n/$name*.properties"(controller: "i18n", action: "index" )

    /login/auth" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "auth"
    }

    "/login/denied" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "denied"
    }

    "/login/authAjax" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "authAjax"
    }

    "/login/authfail" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "authfail"
    }

    "/logout" {
        controller = "logout"
        action = "index"
    }

    "/logout/timeout" {
        controller = "logout"
        action = "timeout"
    }

    "/login/resetPassword" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "forgotpassword"
    }

    "/resetPassword/validateans" {
        controller = "resetPassword"
        action = "validateAnswer"
    }

    "/resetPassword/resetpin" {
        controller = "resetPassword"
        action = "resetPin"
    }

    "/resetPassword/auth" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "auth"
    }

    "/ssb/resetPassword/auth" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "auth"
    }

    "/resetPassword/recovery" {
        controller = "resetPassword"
        action = "recovery"
    }

    "/resetPassword/validateCode" {
        controller = "resetPassword"
        action = "validateCode"
    }

    "/resetPassword/login/auth" {
        controller = "login"
        action = "auth"
    }

    "/resetPassword/logout/timeout" {
        controller = "logout"
        action = "timeout"
    }


#####For Admin apps:
The mappings below are usually added to support Banner XE administrative applications.

    // Special validation URIs

    "/$domainName/validation/" {
        controller = "validation"
        action = [GET: "data"]
    }
    "/$domainName/validation/view" {
        controller = "validation"
        action = [GET: "view"]
    }
    "/$domainName/validation/delete/$id" {
        controller = "validation"
        action = [DELETE: "delete"]
    }
    "/$domainName/validation/create" {
        controller = "validation"
        action = [POST: "create"]
    }
    "/$domainName/validation/update/$id" {
        controller = "validation"
        action = [PUT: "update"]
    }

    "/$controller/$action" { }

    "/$controller/$action/$id" { }

    "/"(view:"/index")
    "500"(controller: "error", action: "internalServerError")
    "403"(controller: "error", action: "accessForbidden")

    //exception for this view
    "/$controller/index"(view:'index')

    "/index.gsp"(view:"/index")

#####For RESTful APIs:
The mappings below are usually added alongside those supporting admin and or SSB, when exposing RESTful APIs using the ['restful-api' Grails plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/restful-api) ([GitHub](https://github.com/restfulapi/restful-api)).

Note that support for these mappings requires use of both the open source restful-api plugin and the Ellucian banner-restful-api-support plugin. _(These mappings are not supported directly by banner-core, but are included here as incorporating RESTful APIs is common across Banner XE applications. Please review the README.md files for each of these plugins.)_

    // ------------------- RESTful API end points --------------------

    // The normal URL mappings used for resources supported by the
    // restful-api plugin.
    //
    "/api/$pluralizedResourceName/$id"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "show", PUT: "update", DELETE: "delete"]
        parseRequest = false
        constraints {
            // to constrain the id to numeric, uncomment the following:
            // id matches: /\d+/
        }
    }

    "/api/$pluralizedResourceName"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "list", POST: "create"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    // Support for nested resources. You may add additional URL mappings to handle
    // additional nested resource requirements.
    //
    "/api/$parentPluralizedResourceName/$parentId/$pluralizedResourceName/$id"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "show", PUT: "update", DELETE: "delete"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    "/api/$parentPluralizedResourceName/$parentId/$pluralizedResourceName"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "list", POST: "save"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    // We'll also expose URLs using a different prefix to support querying with POST.
    //
    "/qapi/$pluralizedResourceName"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "list", POST: "list"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    // Also support mepCode identification before /api/
    //
    "/$mepCode/api/$pluralizedResourceName/$id"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "show", PUT: "update", DELETE: "delete"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    "/$mepCode/api/$pluralizedResourceName"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "list", POST: "create"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    "/$mepCode/api/$parentPluralizedResourceName/$parentId/$pluralizedResourceName/$id"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "show", PUT: "update", DELETE: "delete"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

    "/$mepCode/api/$parentPluralizedResourceName/$parentId/$pluralizedResourceName"(controller:'restfulApi') {
        action = [GET: "list", POST: "save"]
        parseRequest = false
    }

#Security Features

This plugin supports form-based authentication (i.e., a login form), CAS SSO, and External authentication based SSO where an SSO product protects the web applications URL name space and asserts an identity attribute as a configurable HTTP header.  For both CAS assertions and External SSO product assertions, the value asserted is mapped in the Banner General GOBUMAP table where the identity assertion is stored in the column GOBUMAP\_UDC\_ID and the column GOBUMAP_PIDM references the Banner person record. For Banner Administrative users, the Oracle username is obtained by joining the GENERAL.GOBEACC table which is used to connect to the Banner database as the Admin username to support Banner MEP and FGAC.
Spring Security is used as the basis for both authentication and authorization.  In addition to Spring Security, the existing Banner Security (e.g., groups and roles) database configuration is used in order to reduce the client impact of adopting Banner XE solutions.

###High level Overview of Spring Security

Spring Security uses Servlet filters to intercept requests. Rather than specifying all of the filters within the web.xml, a single 'DelegatingFilterProxy' is configured which delegates to a 'filterChain' bean specified within the Spring application context.  The spring-security-core plugin adds the 'DelegatingFilterProxy' (and currently, an Ellucian-modified 'spring_security_cas' plugin also adds filters to the web.xml however this is likely no longer needed and should be re-engineered).

```xml
<filter>
  <filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name> springSecurityFilterChain </filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

As mentioned above, the Spring Security filters are configured within the Spring application context. Rather than using an 'applicationContext.xml' or 'resources.groovy' file to configure these beans, they are added to the application context via the BannerCoreGrailsPlugin.groovy file.

Following are the filters, in order, that are enabled by this plugin (when CAS is enabled):

```
securityContextPersistenceFilter,
logoutFilter,
casAuthenticationFilter,
authenticationProcessingFilter,
securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,
anonymousProcessingFilter,
exceptionTranslationFilter,
filterInvocationInterceptor
```

These filters are briefly described below. _(Please review Spring Security documentation for detailed inforamtion.)_

**securityContextPersistenceFilter**

This first filter loads the SecurityContext (if one already exists) from the SecurityContextRepository, or creates it if necessary. The SecurityContext is used to hold an Authentication object, which contains a UserDetails object that in turn contains the credentials and authorities for the user. The default repository is an HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository that stores the security context within the HTTP Session.

**logoutFilter**

This second filter is used to logout the user when needed.

**bannerPreAuthenticatedFilter**

This filter supports External authentication based SSO and is conditionally included if  the Config.groovy property 
banner.sso.authenticationProvider = "external" is defined.
banner.sso.authenticationAssertionAttribute property defines the HTTP Header name who's value must match the GOBUMAP\_UDC\_ID value stored in Banner.
External authentication SSO products such as Shibboleth, Oracle Access Manager, Novel Access Manager, and CA Site Minder, can be configured to protect the application URL name space and assert a configurable HTTP header attribute as the authenticated user.

**casAuthenticationFilter**

This filter is used to perform CAS-based authentication, and listens for requests to '/j_spring_cas_security_check'.  It is configured with a reference to the authentication manager that in turn is configured with a list of 'authentication providers'. The first provider configured is a CasAuthenticationProvider.

When a request for '/j_spring_cas_security_check' is issued (by a CAS Server), the casAuthenticationFilter will construct an authentication token using the 'ticket' parameter provided in the request.  The authentication manager will then delegate to it's authentication providers, in order, until a provider is able to handle the request. When using CAS, the CasAuthenticationProvider is able to validate the service ticket using a configured ticket validator (which is a Saml11TicketValidator).

The ticket validator calls the CAS Server to validate the service ticket, which will then respond with the username and any additional attributes configured within the CAS Server.  Banner XE is configured to retrieve a configurable identity attribute assertion name defined in Config.groovy as the property "banner.sso.authenticationAssertionAttribute" where the installed default value is 'UDC\_IDENTIFIER'.  This assertion name can be changed to any value that an institution wants to assert as long as the data mapping is defined correctly in the GOBUMAP table. The GOBUMAP\_UDC\_ID column value is an enterprise-wide identifier for the user.

The standard CasAuthenticationProvider would next delegate to a configured userDetailsService.  Banner XE, however, currently (and now unnecessarily) implements a custom CasAuthenticationProvider which does not use a userDetailsService but instead performs the work of this service. (Actually, this provider delegates to the BannerAuthenticationProvider used in support of form-based authentication for this purpose.)

The CasAuthenticationProvider (preferrably in the future, a BannerUserDetailsService) queries the Banner database using the UDC\_IDENTIFIER to look up the user's oracle username and pidm, which it then populates into a BannerUser object that is included within an Authentication object.
The Config.groovy property "banner.sso.authenticationProvider" defines the authentication method.
banner.sso.authenticationProvider = "cas" configures CAS based authentication
banner.sso.authenticationAssertionAttribute = "UDC\_IDENTITFIER" defines the configurable CAS assertion name.

**authenticationProcessingFilter**

The authenticationProcessingFilter is used to perform 'normal' form-based authentication when CAS is not enabled. The default implementation is the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter, which like the CasAuthenticationFilter, is configured with the authentication manager that in turn delegates to a list of authenticated providers. Specifically, this filter is responsible for attaining the username and password from the request object and providing it to the authentication providers configured within the authentication manager.

The BannerAuthenticationProvider is used to authenticate a user by establishing an Oracle database connection using the supplied user credentials. If successful, the provider (currently) determines the user's authorities by querying Banner for the user's roles.  (Note: As discussed above, this responsibility would be better placed within a userDetailsService.)

Specifically, the provider retrieves the effective Banner security roles for the user using a database view. The Banner security role assignments for this user are then used to construct 'security roles' in a format usable by Spring Security. For instance, if a user has been given the BAN_DEFAULT_Q role for object 'FPARORD' and the BAN_DEFAULT_M role for object 'STVCOLL', that user will be granted two 'authorities' named "ROLE_FPARORD_BAN_DEFAULT_Q" and "ROLE_STVCOLL_BAN_DEFAULT_M".  Note: The encrypted passwords associated with these roles are not returned when initially creating the authorities, but are retrieved as needed by the BannerDS when preparing a connection. (The BannerDS adds the role password to the GrantedAuthority representing the role, so the password need only be retrieved once for a role.)
The Config.groovy property "banner.sso.authenticationProvider" defines the authentication method.
banner.sso.authenticationProvider = "default" configures Forms based authentication where Banner Administrative users are authenticated using the Oracle username and password and Self Service users are authenticated via the SPRIDEN_ID and PIN or LDAP authentication based on Web Tailor authentication configuration.
The property banner.sso.authenticationAssertionAttribute is ignored when "default" authentication is specified.

**securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter**

This filter simply wraps and decorates the ServletRequest with additional methods needed to access the Authentication object.

**anonymousProcessingFilter**

If none of the preceding filters have populated a security context, this filter will do so by creating a context for an anonymous user. If there are URIs identified that allow for anonymous access, this security context will allow those users to access those URIs.

**exceptionTranslationFilter**

This filter is used to handle AuthenticationException and AccessDeniedException exceptions that are thrown by the preceeding filters when the Authentication object is either missing or does not reflect a successful authentication.

This last filter will invoke the configured 'entry point', thus starting the 'security processing'.  For example, a LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint would redirect the browser to the configured 'loginFormUrl'. (For Banner XE, note that the LoginController handles the redirect.)  If the entry point is instead a CasAuthenticationEntryPoint, the user's browser would be redirected to the configured CAS Server. The entry point would include a 'service' parameter that identifies a 'callback' URL the CAS Server should use.  (Note this subsequent 'callback' request will be handled by the casAuthenticationFilter discussed above.)

**filterInvocationInterceptor**

This filter performs 'authorization' based upon the required roles needed to access a URI. This filter delegates to an access decision manager, which in turn delegates to one or more decision voters. The banner-core plugin configures a BannerAccessDecisionVoter that determines whether a user is authorized by ensuring the authenticated user's authorities (GrantedBannerAuthority instances) include one needed to access the URI.

While the roles required to access a given URI may be explicitly configured within the 'interceptUrlMap' (which is discussed below), most Banner URIs are configured with a special 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY' role. When the required role is 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY', the BannerAccessDecisionVoter determines the required role based upon the 'FormContext' that associates the URI with Banner Oracle Forms (as Banner security is configured in terms of Banner objects, including forms).

After the request successfully proceeds through the Spring security filters, a 'FormContext' threadlocal is set based upon the configured 'formControllerMap'.  Specifically, when a controller is being accessed the FormContext is set using a 'before filter' and when a composer is being accessed it is set by a custom ZK page filter.

The 'formControllerMap' configured within Config.groovy is used to associate controller and composer names to one or more 'Banner Oracle Forms'.  For instance, if the user is navigating to a "/college" URL, the filter will set a FormContext value of 'STVCOLL' assuming the formControllerMap associates the College controller and or composer with 'STVCOLL'.

While handling the request, when a database connection is needed (either indirectly by the Hibernate ORM library or used explicitly) it is retrieved from the 'BannerDS' dataSource.

The BannerDS dataSource ensures:

* the connection is proxied on behalf of the authenticated user,
* the authorities (roles) previously granted to the user (and which are applicable to this current request) are set on the connection. (If the encrypted password for a needed Banner role has not yet been retrieved, it is retrieved now.)
* the MEP context is set if necessary

When the transaction is committed (either programmatically or declaratively), the connection's proxy session is closed and the connection is returned to the pool.  (This is ensured because the BannerDS wraps each connection within a BannerConnection object before handing it out, and the BannerConnection close() method closes the proxy session before calling close() on the wrapped connection in order to return the connection to the pool.)

Note the FormContext threadlocal is cleared using an 'after' filter.

###Security Configuration
As identified above, there are two important maps that must be configured within the Config.groovy of any project using this plugin. These maps must be updated when introducing new controllers or composers.

Config.groovy must contain a 'formControllerMap' map, similar to the one depicted below.  This map relates controller and composer names to the Banner 8 objects (e.g., Forms) for which they correspond.  Note in most cases there will be a one-to-one mapping, but it is possible that one Grails controller or composer is being used to replace multiple Banner objects.  This map allows for grails applications to leverage existing Banner security configuration.

```groovy
// ******************************************************************************
//          +++ SECURITY: FORM-CONTROLLER MAP & INTERCEPT URL MAP +++
// ******************************************************************************
// This map relates controllers to the Banner forms that it replaces.  This map
// supports 1:1 and 1:M (where a controller supports the functionality of more than
// one Banner form.  This map is critical, as it is used by the security framework to
// set appropriate Banner security role(s) on a database connection. For example, if a
// logged in user navigates to the 'medicalInformation' controller, when a database
// connection is attained and the user has the necessary role, the role is enabled
// for that user and Banner object.  In addition, this information 'may' be used
// when determining if a user is authorized to access the endpoint (see 'interceptUrlMap'
// comments below).
formControllerMap = [
                      'college'            : [ 'STVCOLL' ],
                      'interest'           : [ 'STVINTS' ],
                      'medicalInformation' : [ 'GOAMEDI' ],
                      ...
                    ]
```

The above 'formControllerMap' is used by a 'before filter' (AccessControlFilters.groovy) to set a ThreadLocal with the Banner 8 object name(s) corresponding to the controller or composer being accessed.  The 'FormContext' threadlocal is then used by the security framework when determining whether the user can access the URL mapped to the controller or composer. As described above, this is done by checking the user's 'Banner role assignments' that were cached during the authentication process.

Whether or not a user is allowed to access a URL depends upon a Spring Security Map that defines the roles needed to access each URL.  This map must also be included within Config.groovy, and represents a standard 'acegi' configuration:

```groovy
// The following map is used to secure URLs, based upon authentication or role-based authorization.
// In general, users should be granted access to Banner pages if they have any roles that pertain to
// the corresponding Banner Form/Object (except if their only applicable role ends with '_CONNECT').
// Please see comments below regarding the special 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY' role.
grails.plugin.springsecurity.interceptUrlMap = [
        '/'          : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/zkau/**'   : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/zkau**'    : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/login/**'  : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/mainPage**': ['ROLE_SCACRSE_BAN_DEFAULT_M'], // not in formControllerMap, so we must explicitly identify a role
        '/menu/**'   : ['ROLE_SCACRSE_BAN_DEFAULT_M'], // not in formControllerMap, so we must explicitly identify a role
        '/index**'   : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/logout/**' : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/js/**'     : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/css/**'    : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/images/**' : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/plugins/**': ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],
        '/errors/**' : ['IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'],

        // ALL URIs specified with the BannerAccessDecisionVoter.ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY
        // 'role' (it's not a real role) will result in authorization being determined based
        // upon a user's role assignments to the corresponding form (see 'formControllerMap' above).
        // Note: This 'dynamic form-based authorization' is performed by the BannerAccessDecisionVoter
        // registered as the 'roleVoter' within Spring Security.
        //
        // Only '/name_used_in_formControllerMap/' and '/api/name_used_in_formControllerMap/'
        // URL formats are supported.  That is, the name_used_in_formControllerMap must be first, or
        // immediately after 'api' -- but it cannot be otherwise nested. URIs may be protected
        // by explicitly specifying true roles instead -- as long as ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY
        // is NOT specified.
        //
       '/**': [ 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY' ]
]
```

As described in the code comments above, URLs may be protected with a special 'ROLE_DETERMINED_DYNAMICALLY' role.  A custom 'role voter' is configured by banner-core that will, when a URL is protected by this special role, determine authorization based upon the formControllerMap. Specifically, if a user has ANY roles corresponding to the Banner Classic Form identified in the formControllerMap for the current request, the user is granted access. (Note: Any roles ending with '_CONNECT' are excluded, and are not used to grant access.)

###Configuring RESTful API Security
RESTful API support should be added by using the open source '[restful-api](http://grails.org/plugin/restful-api)' ([GitHub](https://github.com/restfulapi/restful-api)) plugin developed by Ellucian.  Please see the restful-api plugin's [README](https://github.com/restfulapi/restful-api/blob/master/README.md) for general intallation and configuration instructions.

In addition, when using the restful-api plugin along with banner-core, the 'banner-restful-api-support' plugin should be installed as an in-place plugin (and Git submodule) of the application. Please see the banner-restful-api-support plugin's README.md for additional configuration instructions.

###Self Service Banner Security
banner-core blurs the lines somewhat with respect to administrative and self service Banner.  An application using banner-core may be configured to support either administrative users or self service users, or both, within the same instance.

To enable self service, you must set the following configuration.

```groovy
/* ***************************************************************************
 *               Self Service Endpoint Support Enablement                    *
 *************************************************************************** */

// Set 'ssbEnabled' to true for instances that expose Self Service Banner endpoints.
// If this is set to false, or if this configuration item is missing, the instance
// will only support administrative users and not self service users.
//
// If this is enabled, it is important to also ensure the corresponding configuration
// items for the SSB datasource are configured below.
//
ssbEnabled = true                     // default is 'false'
//administrativeBannerEnabled = true  // default is 'true'

// Set 'ssbOracleUsersProxied = true' to ensure that database connections are proxied
// when the user has an oracle account.  This allows FGAC even for SSB pages.
// Set this to false to instead use database connections that are established
// for SSB users who do not have Oracle database accounts.  This setting applies
// only to SSB pages.
ssbOracleUsersProxied = true
```

The above configuration enables self service support, and also configures the solution to proxy database connections for users who have an Oracle database account.  Note that this configuration also allows 'administrative' authentication to be disabled, meaning that users would have to authenticate using spriden_id/pin or employ SSO.  Since administrative support is 'true' by default, this configuration is only needed when setting this to 'false'.

When both self service and administrative Banner are enabled, a SelfServiceBannerAuthenticationProvider is wired into the Spring Security framework.  This provider will attempt to authenticate the user using spriden_id and pin.  If this authentication fails (e.g., because the user does not have a PIDM), then the administrative 'BannerAuthenticationProvider' will attempt authentication based upon Oracle username and password.

It is important to note that when self service is enabled, a second dataSource must be configured to support self service users as shown below:

```groovy
/* ***************************************************************************
 *                Self Service User DataSource Configuration                 *
 *************************************************************************** */

// It is imperative the self-service datasource be configured if 'ssbEnabled = true'.

// JNDI configuration for use in 'production' environment
//
bannerSsbDataSource.jndiName = "jdbc/horizonDataSource"

// Local configuration for use in 'development' and 'test' environments
//
bannerSsbDataSource.url      = "jdbc:oracle:thin:{HOST}:{PORT}:{SID}"
bannerSsbDataSource.username = "ban_ss_user"
bannerSsbDataSource.password = "{PASSWORD}"
bannerSsbDataSource.driver   = "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
```

Note the above configuration is not needed for instances where self service is not enabled.

If the SelfServiceAuthenticationProvider is able to authenticate the user, it will then query the Banner database for the user's web roles. These are converted into Spring Security roles much like the Banner administrative roles.  In addition, if the user has an Oracle database account, the user's Banner administrative roles will also be retrieved and converted to Spring Security roles. In addition,  a special role will be given to the user that will allow access to self service pages and that will unlock the BAN_DEFAULT_ROLE if database connections are proxied.

#Services
The banner-core plugin provides a 'ServiceBase' base class for transactional services that supports the standard CRUD methods.

#####CRUD Method Input Arguments

ServiceBase provides 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'createOrUpdate', 'fetch', and 'list' methods. To facilitate reuse, these methods support various inputs.

The 'create' and 'update' methods accept a single argument, being either:

* An instance of a domain model
* A 'params' Map (i.e., a map holding property key-value entries, such as a normal Grails 'params' map)
* A Map containing a key named after the model's class (in property form), whose instance is held by that key. For instance, to hold an instance of a MyModel model class, you may use a key named 'myModel'.
* A Map that contains a key named 'domainModel', whose value is a domain model instance
* A List that contains any combination of the above. When providing a list, the create/update method will be invoked separately for each element in the list. That is, it does not implement 'true batch processing' but instead provides an 'internal iterator' for convenience.

Similarly, the delete method accepts a single argument, being either:

* An 'id' (either as a 'Long', primitive 'long', or String). If a String representation is provided, it will be coerced into a long if possible otherwise it will be used as a string. In general, we do not have complete support for String primary keys, so in practice a 'long' compatible key should be used.
* An instance of a domain model that has a populated id
* A 'params' map (i.e., a map holding property key-value entries, such as a normal Grails 'params' map)
* A Map containing a key named for the model (in property form) whose instance is held by that key. For instance, to hold an instance of a MyModel model class, you may use a key named 'myModel'.
* A map that contains a 'domainModel' key whose value is a domain model instance
* A List that contains any combination of the above. When providing a list, the create method will be invoked separately for each element in the list. That is, it does not implement 'true batch processing' but instead provides an 'internal iterator' for convenience.

The delete method returns 'true' if the delete was successful, or an exception if it was not successful.

The 'list' and 'read' (as well as a 'get' method providing the same implementation as 'read' under a different name) simply pass along any input arguments to the corresponding GORM 'list' and 'get' methods (e.g., to support paging and filtering).

#####CRUD Method Hook Methods

The 'create', 'update', and 'delete' methods each invoke 'pre' and 'post' methods (e.g., preCreate, postUpdate, etc.) if implemented within the concrete service.  The 'pre' methods are invoked with the same input argument of the create/update/delete method invocation, and the 'post' invocations are provided a map containing status and results of the database operation.

While the 'pre' callback argument is whatever was passed to 'create', the 'post' callback arguments differ slightly for 'create', 'update', and 'delete'.  The 'postCreate' callback is invoked with a single argument: '\[ before: domainModelOrMap, after: createdModel \]' where 'domainModelOrMap' is whatever was passed into the create method, and 'createdModel' is the as-created model instance.  The 'postUpdate' argument is the same, except instead of a 'createdModel' key it contains an 'updatedModel' key. Lastly, the 'postDelete' callback argument looks like: '\[ before: domainObject, after: null \]' where 'domainObject' is the model instance that was fetched from the database and that will be deleted. The 'after' key simply holds null, as the model instance has been deleted.

#####CRUD Method Return Values
The create and update methods return the created/updated model instance if successful, and the 'delete' method returns 'true' if successful.  If any of these method invocations is not successful, they throw an exception.  Usually, the exception to be thrown will be an 'ApplicationException', however it is prudent to write your client that is invoking a service method to first catch ApplicationException (and handle it) and then in a second catch block catch 'Exception' (or Throwable).  This second catch should attempt to handle the exception, and should also log this exception as an 'error' that  should not have been thrown by the service. That is, log an error to indicate that the service should have wrapped this exception into an ApplicationException.

#####Application Exception

The banner-core plugin defines an ApplicationException that is used to wrap various exceptions, provide a common interface, and ensure localization of exception messages. Please refer to 'ApplicationExceptionIntegrationTests.groovy' (contained in this plugin) for example usage.

#####Automatic Refresh
Some domain models are modified within the database, which results in the persisted data being different than that in the domain model or Hibernate cache.  To simplify use of models where this situation exists, a '@DatabaseModifiesState' should be added to the model.  The 'ServiceBase' base class checks for the presence annotation after saving the model, and if present will perform a refresh before returning the model. Domain models that are backed by APIs (i.e., backed by views using instead of triggers that delegate to the API), or that are backed by tables that have triggers that modify the persistent state must have this annotation.  Services that do not extend or mixin ServiceBase should also check for this annotation and refresh the model when appropriate.

```groovy
@Entity
@Table( name="SOME_TABLE" )
@DatabaseModifiesState
class MyModel implements Serializable {
```
###5. Database changes

Following permissions need to be granted to the banproxy user for checking if the logged in user account is locked or expired when the same user logs in through CAS.

    GRANT SELECT ON DBA_USERS TO banproxy

The above sql can be run by any dba user like sysdba.
